////instruction for equation of instruction encoding and decoding
////instruction for equation of displaying graphics, rendering
////instruction for equation of game engine
////instruction for equation of contexualtization/AI
////instruction for equation of ISP/creation of signals and trasmiteting and receivng 
////instruction for equation of machine/app/software/PCL
////instruction for equation of meter that can keep up with scalar field in compressing instruction that are being handeled (see system.v)













































































////That's it. We can add a lot of instructions. I believe in creating machines and software just by equations rather than real code; that's what I call "no code," just straight-up equations. 
////There are no errors or other issues.
////You can create anything with just one thing: a chip for the system. For the instructions, we need a specific chip that can interact with all signal typesâ€”optical for holographic displays, 
////sound signals for displaying sounds, radio signals, etc.
////Without actually needing a electricity, even the design will be a magnetic chip for the sake of using magnetic repulsion or magnetic storage and energy provision.
////It all comes down to physics and chemistry, something I'm not familiar with because I just write code, specifically for hardware.
////You might say about security; the firmware will already contain blocking mechanisms for CP and other banned content using ISP instruction equation.
////Do not forget, this is just a fictional system, nothing more.
